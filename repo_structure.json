These variables are key-value pairs that configure an application’s settings without hardcoding them into the source code. This practice enhances security by keeping sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, and configuration settings separate from the codebase, allowing for easier management and deployment across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). The `.env` file is typically read by libraries that load these variables into the application at runtime.",
