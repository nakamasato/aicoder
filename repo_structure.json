These variables are key-value pairs that configure an application’s settings without hardcoding them into the source code. This practice enhances security by keeping sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, and configuration settings separate from the codebase, allowing for easier management and deployment across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). The `.env` file is typically read by libraries that load these variables into the application at runtime.",

Key components include:\n\n1. **Data Structures**: `FileInfo` represents information about files and directories, while `RepoStructure` captures the entire structure of the repository with metadata such as generation time.\n\n2. **Cobra Command**: The `loaderCmd` command is defined using the Cobra library, allowing users to specify the path to the repository, output file, branch, commit hash, and OpenAI API settings.\n\n3. **OpenAI Integration**: The tool utilizes the OpenAI API for summarizing file contents. It initializes the OpenAI client and checks for an API key from environment variables if not provided.\n\n4. **Repository Loading**: The `loadRepoStructure` function uses the `go-git` library to open the repository and traverse its tree, building the `RepoStructure`. It checks if previous file descriptions exist to avoid redundant summarization.\n\n5. **Recursive Traversal**: The `traverseTree` function recursively explores the repository's tree structure, generates summaries, and populates the `FileInfo` objects.\n\n6. **File Summary Generation**: If a file's content has changed since the last summary, the content is read and sent to OpenAI for summarization. The summaries are included in the output JSON file.\n\nThe final result is a JSON file containing a structured representation of the repository's contents along with generated summaries for each file.",
