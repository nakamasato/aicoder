We are currently addressing the following query given by a user. Here is the query text:
--- BEGIN QUERY ---
{{ .Query }}
--- END QUERY ---

{{ .RepairRelevantFileInstruction }}
--- BEGIN FILE ---
```
{{ .Content }}
```
--- END FILE ---

Please first localize the code based on the query, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to address the query.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...``` or ```go...``` (specify the language accordingly).
